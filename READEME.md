* Explanation of Code:
> Handles missing values
> Encodes categorical symptoms & disease labels
> Standardizes data for ML models
> Trains multiple models with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
> Compares accuracy & selects best-performing model
> Prints all models' best hyperparameters & accuracy
